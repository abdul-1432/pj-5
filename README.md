```

2. Navigate to the project folder.

cd side-menu-bar
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the basic layout.

## Usage

To use the side menu bar in your project, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JS files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/side-menu-bar.css">
<script src="path/to/side-menu-bar.js"></script>
```

2. Create an HTML element to hold your main content and give it an ID.

```HTML
<div id="content">
  <!-- Your main content goes here -->
</div>
```

3. Create a button or any element that will trigger the side menu.

```HTML
<button id="menu-button">Menu</button>
```

4. Initialize the side menu bar by calling the `initSideMenu()` function in your JavaScript file.

```HTML
<script>
  document.getElementById('menu-button).addEventListener('click', function() {
    initSideMenu('content');
  });
</script>
```

Now, when you click the "Menu" button, the side menu will slide in from the left and overlay the main content.

## Customization

You can customize the side menu bar to match your project's design. Open the `side-menu-bar.css` file and modify the CSS variables and styles as needed.

```css
/* Colors */
: root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --background-color: #f8f9fa;
  /* Add more custom variables here */
}

/* Side menu styles */
/* Customize the appearance of the side menu here */

/* ... */

```
